There are many different types of software tests, but some common ones include:

* Unit tests: These tests focus on individual components or units of code, and they are used to ensure that each unit is working correctly.
* Integration tests: These tests focus on how different units of code work together, and they are used to ensure that the components of the system are integrated correctly.
* System tests: These tests focus on the overall behavior of the system, and they are used to ensure that the system is working as expected from the user's perspective.
* Regression tests: These tests are used to ensure that changes to the code do not introduce new bugs or break existing functionality.
* Acceptance tests: These tests are used to determine whether the system meets the requirements and expectations of the end user or customer.
* Performance tests: These tests are used to evaluate the performance and scalability of the system, and they can help identify bottlenecks or other issues that may affect the system's performance.
* Security tests: These tests are used to evaluate the security of the system, and they can help identify potential vulnerabilities or other security risks.

Overall, the specific types of tests that are used will depend on the needs and requirements of the system being tested.
