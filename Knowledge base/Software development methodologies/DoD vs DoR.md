A **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a set of criteria or acceptance standards that a work item must meet in order to be considered complete. In other words, it defines the minimum requirements that must be satisfied for a product or feature to be considered finished. This can include things like code being reviewed and tested, documentation being written, and any other tasks that need to be completed before the work can be considered done.

A **Definition of Ready (DoR)**, on the other hand, is a set of criteria that a work item must meet before it can be considered ready to begin work. This can include things like having all necessary information and resources, having clear acceptance criteria, and ensuring that the work item is well understood by the team.

In short, a DoD defines what needs to be done in order for a product or feature to be considered complete, while a DoR defines what needs to be done in order for a product or feature to be ready to begin work. These two concepts are often used in [[Agile|agile]] software development methodologies, such as Scrum, to ensure that teams are working on the right things at the right time and that their work is of high quality.
