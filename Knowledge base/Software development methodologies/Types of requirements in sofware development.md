In software development, there are two main types of requirements: ___functional requirements___ and ___non-functional requirements___.

[[Functional requirements]] specify what a software system should do. They describe the tasks that the system should be able to perform and the inputs and outputs associated with those tasks. Functional requirements are usually expressed in terms of specific actions or behaviors that the system should be able to perform.

[[Non-functional requirements]], on the other hand, specify how a software system should behave or perform in terms of certain attributes or characteristics. These requirements do not specify specific functions or behaviors, but rather describe the overall qualities that the system should possess. Examples of non-functional requirements include reliability, usability, performance, security, and maintainability.

>[!NOTE]
>Both functional and non-functional requirements are important for ensuring that a software system meets the needs of its users and stakeholders. Properly identifying and managing these requirements is an essential part of the software development process.
