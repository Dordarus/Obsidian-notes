Functional requirements are specific actions or behaviors that a software system should be able to perform. They describe the tasks that the system should be able to carry out and the inputs and outputs associated with those tasks.

Functional requirements are usually expressed in terms of user stories, which are short, simple descriptions of a feature or behavior from the perspective of the user. For example:

-   As a customer, I want to be able to view my account balance so that I can keep track of my spending.
-   As an administrator, I want to be able to add new users to the system so that I can give them access to the system.

Functional requirements are important for ensuring that a software system is able to perform the tasks that it is intended to do. They help to define the scope and functionality of the system and provide a basis for testing and verifying that the system is working correctly.

Properly identifying and managing functional requirements is an essential part of the software development process. This typically involves gathering requirements from stakeholders, such as users, customers, and business analysts, and then documenting and organizing them in a clear and concise manner. The requirements can then be used to guide the design and development of the software system.
