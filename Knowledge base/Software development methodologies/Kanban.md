Kanban is a method for managing and improving workflows, originally developed in the manufacturing industry but now also widely used in software development and other fields. Kanban is based on the principle of visualizing work as it moves through a process, and using this visualization to identify bottlenecks and optimize the flow of work.

In Kanban, work is represented by cards on a board. The board typically consists of columns that represent different stages in the workflow, and the cards represent individual tasks or pieces of work. As work progresses through the process, the cards are moved from column to column.

One of the key features of Kanban is the use of "limits" on the number of cards that can be in each column at a given time. These limits help to prevent overloading of resources and ensure that work is completed in a timely manner.

Kanban can be used in a variety of contexts, including software development, marketing, customer service, and many other fields. It is often used in combination with other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum.
