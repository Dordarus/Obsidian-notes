DevOps is a software development approach that emphasizes collaboration and communication between development and operations teams. The goal of DevOps is to create a culture and environment in which development, testing, and operations work together seamlessly in order to deliver value to customers more quickly and efficiently.

DevOps practices include:

1. **Automation**: Automating as much of the software delivery process as possible, including testing, deployment, and infrastructure management.

2. **Continuous integration and delivery**: Building and testing code changes continuously, and releasing them to production as soon as they are ready.

3. **Collaboration and communication**: Encouraging collaboration and communication between development and operations teams, and involving all stakeholders in the software development process.

4. **Monitoring and feedback**: Monitoring the performance and reliability of software in production, and using this feedback to improve the development process.

5. **Lean principles**: Adopting [[Lean|lean]] principles, such as continuous improvement and the elimination of waste, to optimize the software delivery process.
