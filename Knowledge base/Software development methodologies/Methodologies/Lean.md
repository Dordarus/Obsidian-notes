Lean development is a software development approach that is based on the principles of lean manufacturing and lean management. The goal of lean development is to eliminate waste and optimize the flow of value through the development process.

Lean development is similar to [[Agile|Agile development]] in that it emphasizes flexibility and continuous improvement. However, there are some key differences between the two approaches:

1. **Focus**: Agile development focuses on delivering working software early and often, while lean development focuses on maximizing value and minimizing waste.

2. **Prioritization**: Agile development emphasizes prioritizing and completing the most valuable work first, while lean development focuses on continuously improving the flow of value through the development process.

3. **Metrics**: Agile development often uses metrics such as velocity or burn-down charts to track progress, while lean development emphasizes the use of metrics such as lead time, cycle time, and throughput to identify and eliminate waste.

4. **Documentation**: Agile development emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, while lean development emphasizes just-in-time documentation that is only produced when needed.

>Overall, while Agile and lean development have many similarities, they have different focus areas and use different techniques and approaches to optimize the development process.
