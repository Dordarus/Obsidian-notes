Agile development is a software development methodology that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration. It is based on the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles for software development that values individuals and interactions, working solutions, and customer collaboration over processes and tools.

In contrast to the Waterfall model, which follows a linear and sequential approach, Agile development follows a flexible and iterative approach. This means that the project is divided into smaller chunks or "sprints," and the requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing and cross-functional teams.

The Agile methodology is well-suited for projects with rapidly changing or ambiguous requirements, as it allows for flexibility and adaptation to change. It is also well-suited for projects where it is important to involve the end users in the development process, as it emphasizes customer collaboration.

There are many different Agile frameworks and approaches, including [[#Scrum]], [[#Extreme Programming (XP)]], and [[#Lean development]]. Each of these frameworks has its own set of principles and practices, but they all follow the basic principles of the Agile Manifesto.

###### Agile Manifesto

The Agile Manifesto is a set of guiding values and principles for Agile software development. It was created in 2001 by a group of leading software experts who were looking for a better way to develop software projects.

The Agile Manifesto consists of four main values:

1.  Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.  Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.  Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.  Responding to change over following a plan

These values are intended to guide the development of software in a way that is flexible, responsive, and customer-focused. The Agile Manifesto is not a specific methodology or process, but rather a set of principles that can be applied in various ways depending on the needs of the project.

## Scrum

Scrum is a framework for Agile development that is commonly used for managing complex projects. It is based on the Agile Manifesto and its principles of ___flexibility___, ___collaboration___, and ___customer focus___.

In Scrum, the project is divided into small chunks or "sprints," typically lasting two to four weeks. The team works together to define and prioritize the features that will be included in each sprint, and then works to complete those features within the sprint. At the end of each sprint, the team reviews the progress made and identifies any areas for improvement.

The key roles in Scrum include the ___Scrum Master___, who is responsible for facilitating the process and removing any obstacles that may arise; the ___Product Owner___, who represents the interests of the stakeholders and is responsible for defining the product vision and prioritizing the features; and the ___development team___, who are responsible for completing the work.

>[!NOTE]
>Scrum is a flexible framework that can be used in a variety of contexts, including software development, product development, and project management. It is well-suited for projects with rapidly changing or ambiguous requirements, as it allows for flexibility and adaptation to change.

## Extreme Programming (XP)

Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that is based on the Agile Manifesto and its principles of flexibility, collaboration, and customer focus. It is a set of practices designed to improve the quality and speed of software development by emphasizing communication, simplicity, and continuous improvement.

XP has a set of 12 principles that guide the development process, including:

1. **Communication**: XP emphasizes the importance of clear and open communication among all team members.
2. **Simplicity**: The goal is to keep the design of the software as simple as possible, without unnecessary complexity.
3. **Feedback**: XP encourages continuous feedback from the customer and the team to ensure that the software meets the customer's needs.
4. **Courage**: The team should have the courage to make decisions and take risks, even if it means making changes to the plan.
5. **Respect**: All team members should be treated with respect and valued for their contributions.
6. **Focus**: The team should focus on delivering valuable software, rather than getting caught up in non-essential activities.
7. **Flow**: The team should strive to create a continuous flow of work, rather than working in large batches.
8. Testing: XP emphasizes the importance of testing at all stages of the development process.
9. **Refactoring**: The team should constantly review and improve the design of the software to ensure that it is simple and maintainable.
10. **Pair programming:** XP encourages the use of pair programming, where two developers work together on the same code.
11. **Collective ownership**: All team members should be responsible for the quality of the code and should feel free to make any necessary changes.
12. **Continuous integration**: XP encourages the use of continuous integration, where code changes are automatically built and tested on a regular basis.

>[!NOTE]
>XP is well-suited for projects with rapidly changing or ambiguous requirements, as it allows for flexibility and adaptation to change. It is also well-suited for projects where it is important to involve the end users in the development process, as it emphasizes customer collaboration.

## Lean development

Lean development is a software development methodology that is based on the principles of lean manufacturing, which aims to maximize value and minimize waste. In lean development, the focus is on delivering value to the customer as quickly as possible, while minimizing waste and inefficiencies in the development process. Lean development is based on the principles of the Agile manifesto, which emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and customer focus. It is one of the many frameworks and approaches that fall under the umbrella of Agile development.

The key principles of lean development (manufacturing) include:

1. **Value**: The goal is to deliver value to the customer as quickly as possible.
2. **Value stream**: The value stream is the series of activities that create value for the customer. Lean development aims to optimize the value stream by identifying and eliminating waste.
3. **Flow**: Lean development aims to create a continuous flow of value, rather than working in large batches.
4. **Pull**: Lean development uses a pull system, where work is only started when it is needed, rather than working on a predetermined schedule.
5. **Perfection**: Lean development aims for continuous improvement, striving for perfection in the value stream.
6. **Respect for people**: Lean development values and respects the contributions of all team members.
7. **Continuous improvement**: Lean manufacturing emphasizes the importance of continuously identifying and addressing areas for improvement.

Like other Agile frameworks, Lean development emphasizes the importance of delivering value to the customer as quickly as possible, while minimizing waste and inefficiencies in the development process. It also values collaboration and continuous improvement, and encourages flexibility and adaptability to change.

However, Lean development has a specific focus on maximizing value and minimizing waste, which is derived from the principles of lean manufacturing. It also emphasizes the use of a pull system, where work is only started when it is needed, rather than working on a predetermined schedule.

>[!INFO]
>There are many different lean development frameworks and approaches, including Lean Software Development, Lean Startup, and Lean UX. Each of these frameworks has its own set of principles and practices, but they all follow the basic principles of lean development.

> [!NOTE]
> Overall, Lean development is a holistic approach to software development that combines the principles of Agile development with the principles of lean manufacturing to create a process that is focused on delivering value to the customer as quickly and efficiently as possible.

## Agile and Kanban

[[Kanban]] is often used in combination with Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, as a way to manage and improve the flow of work. In this context, Kanban can be used to visualize and optimize the flow of work within the framework of an Agile project.

One way to use Kanban in combination with Agile is to adopt a hybrid approach that combines elements of both Kanban and Scrum. For example, a team might use Scrum to plan and prioritize work, but then use Kanban to visualize and manage the flow of that work through the development process.

Another way to combine Kanban and Agile is to use Kanban as a way to continuously improve and refine an Agile process. For example, a team might start by following a specific Agile methodology, such as Scrum, but then use Kanban to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the process and make adjustments as needed.

### Scrumban

Scrumban is a term that is often used to describe the combination of Kanban and Scrum. Scrum is an Agile methodology that is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Kanban is a method for managing and improving workflows, which is based on the principles of visualizing work and using limits to optimize flow.

When these two approaches are combined, it is often referred to as Scrumban. The term Scrumban was coined by ___Corey Ladas___ in his book ___"ScrumBan: Agile Project Management with Scrum and Kanban."___ Ladas used the term to describe a hybrid approach that combines the best practices of both Scrum and Kanban.

In a Scrumban approach, teams may use Scrum to plan and prioritize work, but then use Kanban to visualize and manage the flow of that work through the development process. This can be a powerful way to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Agile projects.

While the term Scrumban is widely used, it is not an official or standardized term. It is simply a way to describe the combination of Scrum and Kanban in a hybrid approach.

>[!NOTE]
>Overall, the combination of Kanban and Agile can be a powerful tool for managing and improving the flow of work in a variety of contexts. By visualizing and optimizing the flow of work, teams can deliver value to customers more efficiently and effectively.
