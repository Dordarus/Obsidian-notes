Lean development is a software development approach that is based on the principles of lean manufacturing and lean management. It has many potential benefits, but it also has some limitations and challenges that should be considered.

## Pros

1. **Increased value**: Lean development emphasizes maximizing value and minimizing waste, which can lead to higher quality software that better meets the needs of customers.

2. **Faster delivery**: Lean development aims to optimize the flow of value through the development process, which can help to speed up delivery times.

3. **Continuous improvement**: Lean development emphasizes continuous improvement, which can help teams to identify and eliminate waste and inefficiencies in the development process.

4. **Greater transparency**: Lean development emphasizes the use of metrics and visual management techniques to track progress and identify problems, which can increase transparency and accountability.


## Cons

1. **Complexity**: Lean development can be complex, especially for large or complex projects. It requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that work is completed efficiently and effectively.

2.  **Resistance to change**: Some stakeholders may resist the lean approach because it requires a significant shift in the way work is done and may require changes to existing processes and practices.

3. **Lack of structure**: Some organizations may find it challenging to adopt lean development because it lacks the structure and rigidity of more traditional approaches.

4. **Limited focus**: While lean development emphasizes value and minimization of waste, it may not give sufficient attention to other important aspects of software development, such as design and architecture.
