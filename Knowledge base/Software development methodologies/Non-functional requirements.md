Non-functional requirements are requirements that specify how a system should perform, rather than what the system should do. They describe the system's overall behavior, as opposed to its specific functionality. Some examples of non-functional requirements include performance requirements (e.g. response time, throughput), reliability requirements (e.g. uptime, failure rate), and security requirements (e.g. authentication, access control). These requirements are often considered in the design and development of a system, and they can have a significant impact on the system's overall quality and usability.

The core principles of non-functional requirements can be summarized as follows:

* Non-functional requirements are about how a system should perform, rather than what it should do. They describe the overall behavior of the system, rather than its specific functionality.

* Non-functional requirements are often intangible and difficult to measure, making it challenging to test and verify that they have been satisfied.

* Non-functional requirements can have a significant impact on the quality and usability of a system, and should be carefully considered during the design and development process.

* Non-functional requirements can be grouped into several broad categories, including performance, reliability, security, maintainability, and usability.

* Non-functional requirements often have trade-offs, meaning that satisfying one requirement may come at the expense of another. For example, increasing performance may require sacrificing some level of reliability, or improving security may make the system more complex and difficult to use.

* Non-functional requirements should be clearly defined and documented, so that they can be used as a basis for evaluating the system's overall quality and performance. This can help ensure that the system meets the needs and expectations of its users.

## Non-functional requirement in software development

^1de1f9

In the context of software development, non-functional requirements are requirements that describe how a system should behave or perform, rather than what the system should do. These requirements are often used to evaluate the quality of a software system, rather than its functionality.

Examples of non-functional requirements in a software development may include:

1. **Performance**: Requirements related to the speed, efficiency, and scalability of the software, such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization.

2. **Security**: Requirements related to the security of the software, including requirements for authentication, authorization, data protection, and network security.

3. **Reliability**: Requirements related to the reliability and availability of the software, including requirements for uptime, error handling, and recovery.

4. **Maintainability**: Requirements related to the ease of maintaining and updating the software, including requirements for code quality, modularity, and documentation.

5. **Usability**: Requirements related to the usability of the software, including requirements for user interface design, user experience, and accessibility.

>[!NOTE]
>Non-functional requirements are often critical to the success of a software system, as they can have a significant impact on the performance, security, and overall quality of the system. It is important to carefully consider and define non-functional requirements early in the development process to ensure that the final product meets the needs of the users and stakeholders.

## Non-functional requirement and Agile

[[Agile]] development approaches, such as Scrum and Lean, place a strong emphasis on delivering working software early and often. This can make it challenging to fully address non-functional requirements, which may require more in-depth testing and analysis to evaluate.

However, non-functional requirements are still an important consideration in Agile development. Agile teams may need to adopt different strategies to address non-functional requirements in an iterative and incremental way.

For example, an Agile team might use techniques such as continuous testing, automated testing, and performance monitoring to test and validate non-functional requirements throughout the development process. Alternatively, the team might prioritize certain non-functional requirements and address them early in the development process to ensure that they are adequately addressed.

>[!NOTE]
>Overall, while non-functional requirements can be challenging to address in an Agile development context, they are still an important consideration and should be carefully considered and managed as part of the development process.

## How to understand which non-functional requirements are needed?

To understand which non-functional requirements are needed, it is important to first understand the purpose and context of the product or system being developed. Non-functional requirements are the characteristics of a system that do not relate to specific functions or behaviors, but rather describe how the system should perform, behave, or be used. These requirements are often referred to as "quality attributes" because they describe the overall quality or properties of the system.

One approach to determining which non-functional requirements are needed is to consider the stakeholders of the system and what their needs and expectations are. This may include users, customers, regulators, and other parties that have an interest in the system. It is also important to consider the operating environment in which the system will be used, as this can have a significant impact on the non-functional requirements.

Another approach is to use a framework or set of guidelines to help identify and prioritize non-functional requirements. For example, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has a set of quality management standards that provide guidance on identifying and managing non-functional requirements.

>[!NOTE]
>Ultimately, the best approach to understanding which non-functional requirements are needed will depend on the specific context and goals of the product or system being developed. It may be helpful to work with a team of experts or consult with industry professionals to ensure that all relevant non-functional requirements are identified and considered.

## Selecting non-functional requirements for a new feature or project

Selecting non-functional requirements for a new feature or project involves considering the overall goals and objectives of the feature or project, as well as the needs and expectations of the stakeholders.

Here are some steps that you can follow to select non-functional requirements:

1. **Identify the stakeholders**: Determine who will be affected by or have an interest in the feature or project. This can include users, customers, business partners, and other internal or external parties.

3. **Define the goals and objectives**: Clearly define the overall goals and objectives of the feature or project. This will help you to understand what the feature or project is trying to achieve and what non-functional requirements may be relevant.

3. **Gather information**: Collect information from the stakeholders about their needs and expectations. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, or other methods.

4. **Identify [[#^1de1f9|potential non-functional requirements]]**: Based on the information that you have gathered, identify potential non-functional requirements that may be relevant to the feature or project.

5. **Prioritize the non-functional requirements**: Determine which non-functional requirements are most important for the feature or project, based on the goals and objectives, stakeholder needs and expectations, and any constraints or limitations.

6. **Document the non-functional requirements**: Clearly document the selected non-functional requirements, including any specific criteria or acceptance criteria that should be met.

>[!NOTE]
>It is important to regularly review and update the non-functional requirements as the feature or project progresses, to ensure that they are still relevant and aligned with the goals and objectives of the project.
