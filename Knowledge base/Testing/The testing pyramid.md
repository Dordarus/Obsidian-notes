The testing pyramid is a concept that describes the relationship between different types of software tests. It suggests that, in order to have a well-rounded and effective testing strategy, you should have a balance of high-level and low-level tests, with a larger number of low-level tests and a smaller number of high-level tests.

At the base of the pyramid are unit tests, which test individual components or units of code in isolation. These tests are typically the most numerous, and they are used to ensure that each unit of the code is working correctly.

Above the unit tests are integration tests, which test how different units of code work together. These tests are used to ensure that the different components of the system are integrated correctly and are able to communicate with each other.

At the top of the pyramid are end-to-end tests, which test the entire system from start to finish. These tests are used to ensure that the system is working as expected from the user's perspective, and that all of the different components are working together correctly.

The testing pyramid is a useful way to think about the different types of tests that should be included in a testing strategy, and it helps to ensure that the right balance of tests is used to thoroughly test a system. However, the exact shape of the pyramid will vary depending on the specific needs and requirements of the system being tested.
