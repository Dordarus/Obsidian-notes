In computer programming, asynchronous refers to the occurrence of events independently of the main program flow and allows a program to run multiple tasks concurrently.

Asynchronous programming is useful when you want to run tasks concurrently, especially when one task is dependent on the completion of another task. For example, if you have a task that takes a long time to complete, such as downloading a large file from the internet, you can use asynchronous programming to run that task concurrently with other tasks in your program. This can help your program to remain responsive to user input while the long-running task is being completed in the background.

In Ruby, you can use the `async` and `await` keywords to define and execute asynchronous tasks. Here is an example of how to use these keywords to perform a simple asynchronous task:

```ruby
require 'async'

# Define an async task
async def fetch_data
  # Perform some long-running task
  data = HTTP.get("https://example.com/large_file.zip")
  puts "Data fetched"
  data
end

# Execute the async task
result = Async do
  data = await fetch_data
  # Do something with the data
  puts "Processing data"
  data
end

# Wait for the async task to complete
result.wait
```

In this example, the `fetch_data` task is defined as an asynchronous task using the `async` keyword. The task performs a long-running HTTP request to download a large file from the internet. The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the task until the data has been fetched. Finally, the `Async` block is used to execute the async task, and the `wait` method is used to wait for the task to complete.

>[!INFO]
>The `async` and `await` keywords were introduced in Ruby 3.0 as part of the Async/Await syntax for asynchronous programming. These keywords are part of the standard library in **Ruby 3.0** and later versions.

>[!NOTE]
>Asynchronous programming can be useful for improving the performance and responsiveness of your Ruby programs, especially when you need to perform long-running tasks concurrently with other tasks.

### Using Thread class

The `Thread` class in Ruby allows you to create and control separate threads of execution within a Ruby program. You can use the `Thread` class to perform tasks concurrently with other tasks in your program.

Here is an example of how to use the `Thread` class to perform a simple asynchronous task in Ruby:

```ruby
# Define a task to be run in a separate thread
thread = Thread.new do
  # Perform some long-running task
  data = HTTP.get("https://example.com/large_file.zip")
  puts "Data fetched"
  data
end

# Do other things in the main thread while the task is running in the separate thread
puts "Doing other things..."

# Wait for the thread to complete
thread.join

# Do something with the data returned by the thread
data = thread.value
puts "Processing data"
```

In this example, a new thread is created using the `Thread.new` method and a block of code is passed to the thread to be executed. The block of code performs a long-running HTTP request to download a large file from the internet. The main thread of execution continues to run concurrently with the separate thread, allowing you to perform other tasks while the long-running task is being completed in the background. Finally, the `join` method is used to wait for the separate thread to complete, and the `value` method is used to retrieve the return value of the thread.

## Async/Await syntax

The Async/Await syntax introduced in Ruby 3.0 uses threads under the hood to implement asynchronous tasks. When you define an async task using the `async` keyword and execute it using the `Async` block, Ruby creates a new thread to run the async task concurrently with the main thread of execution.

The `await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the async task and allow other tasks to be scheduled on the same thread. When an async task encounters an `await` expression, it yields control back to the scheduler, which can then schedule other tasks to run on the same thread. Once the task being awaited has completed, the async task can resume execution and continue processing the results.

The Async/Await syntax provides a simpler and more integrated way to perform asynchronous programming in Ruby compared to using the `Thread` class directly. It abstracts away the details of thread management and scheduling, allowing you to focus on the logic of your async tasks.

>[!NOTE]
>Overall, the Async/Await syntax is built on top of the `Thread` class and other underlying concurrency mechanisms in Ruby, but it provides a higher-level interface for defining and executing asynchronous tasks.
