Sidekiq is a Ruby gem that provides a background job processing library for Ruby on Rails applications. One of the key features of Sidekiq is its ability to process jobs in parallel, using a pool of worker threads.

Sidekiq uses a multithreaded design to process jobs in parallel. When Sidekiq is started, it creates a pool of worker threads, each of which is responsible for processing jobs from a queue. When a job is added to the queue, any idle worker thread can pick up the job and start processing it. This allows Sidekiq to process multiple jobs simultaneously, improving the performance and throughput of the application.

Sidekiq uses a variety of techniques to ensure that the worker threads are used efficiently and do not cause conflicts or race conditions. For example, Sidekiq uses a locking mechanism to prevent multiple worker threads from processing the same job simultaneously. Sidekiq also has a built-in retry mechanism that automatically retries failed jobs, allowing the application to handle failures and errors gracefully.

Here are some of the techniques that Sidekiq uses to process jobs in parallel:

1. **Multithreading**: Sidekiq uses a pool of worker threads to process jobs in parallel. Each worker thread is responsible for picking up jobs from the queue and processing them. This allows Sidekiq to process multiple jobs simultaneously, improving performance and throughput. 
2. **Locking**: Sidekiq uses a locking mechanism to prevent multiple worker threads from processing the same job simultaneously. This helps to avoid conflicts and race conditions, ensuring that each job is processed exactly once.
3. **Retry mechanism**: Sidekiq has a built-in retry mechanism that automatically retries failed jobs. This allows the application to handle failures and errors gracefully, without losing any data or processing any job multiple times.
4. **Job scheduling**: Sidekiq allows jobs to be scheduled to run at a specific time in the future. This can be useful for tasks that need to be performed periodically, such as sending emails or running maintenance tasks.
5. **Job prioritization**: Sidekiq allows jobs to be assigned different priorities, allowing the most important jobs to be processed first. This can be useful for applications that have a mix of high- and low-priority tasks.
6. **Job dependencies**: Sidekiq allows jobs to be defined with dependencies on other jobs. This allows for complex, multi-step workflows to be defined and executed reliably.

Overall, these techniques allow Sidekiq to process jobs in parallel efficiently and effectively, providing Ruby on Rails applications with a powerful background job processing library.
