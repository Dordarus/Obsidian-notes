The Global Interpreter Lock, or GIL, is a mechanism in the Ruby interpreter that prevents multiple native threads from executing Ruby code simultaneously. This is done to protect the interpreter's internal data structures from being corrupted by multiple threads accessing them simultaneously.

The GIL is implemented as a mutex, or mutual exclusion lock, that allows only one thread to execute Ruby code at a time. When a thread acquires the GIL, it can execute Ruby code until it releases the GIL or until a certain time threshold is reached, at which point the GIL is released and another thread can acquire it.

The GIL can have an impact on the performance of multithreaded Ruby programs on multi-core systems, as it effectively limits the program to only using one core at a time. This means that even if a program is using multiple threads, it may not be able to fully utilize the resources of a multi-core system.

There are ways to work around the GIL in Ruby, such as using the `parallel` gem or the `parallel` command-line tool, which provide methods and utilities for parallelizing tasks using multiple processes instead of threads. However, these approaches have their own trade-offs and limitations.
