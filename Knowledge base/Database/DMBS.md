A robust database management system (DBMS) is a software platform that is designed to efficiently manage and manipulate data stored in a database. A DBMS provides a number of features and functions that allow users to create, retrieve, update, and delete data, as well as define and enforce constraints and rules to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data.

Some of the key features of a robust DBMS include:

1. Transaction management: A robust DBMS should provide support for transactions, which allow users to group multiple database operations into a single logical unit of work. Transactions provide the ability to roll back changes if an error occurs, ensuring that the database remains in a consistent state.
2. Concurrency control: A robust DBMS should support concurrency control, which allows multiple transactions to access and modify the same data without causing conflicts or corruption. This is typically achieved through the use of locks or other mechanisms.
3. Security: A robust DBMS should provide robust security features to protect against unauthorized access to data and prevent data leaks. This may include features such as encryption, user authentication, and access controls.
4. Scalability: A robust DBMS should be able to handle a large volume of data and a high number of concurrent users without experiencing performance degradation.
5. Data modeling and schema management: A robust DBMS should provide support for defining and enforcing the structure and constraints of the data stored in the database, as well as the relationships between different data entities.

>In summary, a robust DBMS is essential for ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of a database. Choosing the right DBMS is an important decision that can have a significant impact on the success of a project.

Here are a few examples of DBMS:

1. **MySQL**: An open-source relational DBMS that is widely used for web applications and data warehousing.
2. **Oracle**: A commercial relational DBMS that is known for its scalability and support for high-concurrency environments.
3. **Microsoft SQL Server**: A commercial relational DBMS that is popular for enterprise applications and data warehousing.
4. **PostgreSQL**: An open-source object-relational DBMS that is known for its support for complex SQL queries and data types.
5. **MongoDB**: A popular open-source NoSQL DBMS that is designed for storing and querying large amounts of unstructured data.
6. **Cassandra**: An open-source NoSQL DBMS that is designed for high availability and scalability, and is often used for large-scale applications with high read and write loads.
