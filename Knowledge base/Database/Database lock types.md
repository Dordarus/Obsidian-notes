Database locks are used to protect the integrity of the data in a database by preventing multiple transactions from accessing and modifying the same data simultaneously. When a transaction acquires a lock on a piece of data, other transactions are prevented from accessing or modifying that data until the lock is released.

There are several different types of locks that can be used in a database, including:

1. **Shared locks**: Allow multiple transactions to read data simultaneously, but prevent any of them from updating the data until the lock is released. This allows multiple transactions to access the data for reading purposes, but ensures that only one transaction can modify the data at a time.

2. **Exclusive locks**: Prevent all other transactions from accessing the data until the lock is released. This ensures that only one transaction can access the data at a time, but can also lead to slower performance because other transactions have to wait for the lock to be released before they can access the data.

3. **Intent locks**: Used to protect the resources that a transaction intends to access, rather than the data itself. There are different types of intent locks, including intent shared locks and intent exclusive locks. Intent shared locks indicate that a transaction intends to read data, while intent exclusive locks indicate that a transaction intends to modify data. These locks can be used to prevent conflicts between transactions that are accessing the same resources.

Locks are an important part of database transactions because they ensure that multiple transactions can access the same data without causing conflicts or corruption. For example, if two transactions try to update the same piece of data at the same time, the database could end up with inconsistent or incorrect data  if both updates are applied. By using locks, the database can ensure that only one transaction can update the data at a time, ensuring the integrity of the data ([[ACID#Consistency]]).

### Common problems you’ll run into with database locks

Here are some common problems you might encounter with database locks:

1. **Deadlocks**: A deadlock occurs when two transactions are waiting for each other to release a lock, resulting in a standstill. Deadlocks can be caused by a circular dependency between transactions, where each transaction is waiting for a lock held by the other transaction. ^26fc88
2. **Lock contention**: Lock contention occurs when multiple transactions are trying to acquire the same lock at the same time, causing delays and reduced performance.
3. **Lock escalation**: When a transaction acquires too many locks on a single table or a large number of locks on multiple tables, it can cause lock escalation, where the database server tries to improve performance by converting many fine-grained locks into a single, more coarse-grained lock. This can cause problems for other transactions that need to access the locked data.
4. **Lock timeouts**: If a transaction takes too long to acquire a lock, it may time out and fail, resulting in an error.

>To avoid these problems, it's important to design transactions carefully, minimize the number of locks taken, and ensure that transactions are short-lived and release locks as soon as they are no longer needed. It's also a good idea to use a robust database management system ([[DMBS]]) that can handle lock management efficiently.
>Most SQL databases follow a set of principles called _[[ACID]]_ that prioritises transactional integrity. But the reason principles works is that databases use _[[Database Isolation and read phenomenas| locks]]_ that prevent data from being read or changed while a transaction is making use of it.
