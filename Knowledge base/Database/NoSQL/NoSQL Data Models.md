NoSQL databases support a variety of different data models, including:

1. **Key-value store**: A key-value store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in the form of key-value pairs. The key is used to identify a particular record, and the value is the data stored in that record. Key-value stores are designed to provide fast access to data and are often used for storing large amounts of data that need to be quickly retrieved. Examples of key-value stores include Redis and DynamoDB.

2. **Document store**: A document store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents. A document is a collection of fields, with each field containing a value. Document stores are designed to store semi-structured data, and are often used for storing data that is hierarchical in nature. Examples of document stores include MongoDB and Couchbase.

3. **Column store**: A column store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in the form of columns rather than rows. Column stores are designed to store large amounts of data efficiently and are often used for data warehousing and analytics. Examples of column stores include Cassandra and HBase.

4. **Graph store**: A graph store is a type of NoSQL database that stores data in the form of nodes and edges. Nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between entities. Graph stores are designed to store data that is highly connected and are often used for storing data that is complex and hierarchical in nature. Examples of graph stores include Neo4j and OrientDB.

5. **Multi-model database**: A multi-model database is a type of NoSQL database that supports multiple data models. This type of database allows users to choose the data model that best fits their needs, and it can support multiple data models within a single database. Examples of multi-model databases include Cosmos DB and OrientDB.
