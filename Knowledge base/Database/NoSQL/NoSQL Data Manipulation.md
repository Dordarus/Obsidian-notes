NoSQL databases typically use a variety of different query languages or APIs for data manipulation. Some examples of query languages and APIs that are commonly used with NoSQL databases include:

1. **MongoDB**: MongoDB uses a query language called ___MongoDB Query Language (MQL)___ for data manipulation. MQL is a syntax similar to SQL, but it is designed specifically for use with MongoDB.

2. **Cassandra**: Cassandra uses a query language called ___Cassandra Query Language (CQL)___ for data manipulation. CQL is a syntax similar to SQL, but it is designed specifically for use with Cassandra.

3. **Redis**: Redis uses a query language called ___Redis command set for data manipulation___. The Redis command set includes a variety of commands for manipulating data, such as SET, GET, and DEL.

4. **Couchbase**: Couchbase uses a query language called ___N1QL (Non-First Normal Form Query Language)___ for data manipulation. N1QL is a syntax similar to SQL, but it is designed specifically for use with Couchbase.

5. **DynamoDB**: DynamoDB uses a query language called ___DynamoDB Query Language (DQL)___ for data manipulation. DQL is a syntax similar to SQL, but it is designed specifically for use with DynamoDB.

6. **Cosmos DB**: Cosmos DB uses a query language called ___SQL (Structured Query Language)___ for data manipulation. SQL is a widely used query language for manipulating data in relational databases. Cosmos DB also supports several APIs for data manipulation, including the ___MongoDB API___, __Cassandra API__, and ___Azure Table API___.
