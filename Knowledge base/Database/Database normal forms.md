Database normalization is the process of organizing a database in a way that reduces redundancy and dependency. It is a technique for designing relational database tables to minimize data redundancy, and to improve data integrity and data consistency.

There are several different normal forms that can be used to normalize a database, and the specific normal form that is used depends on the needs of the database and the specific requirements of the application. The most common normal forms are:

1. [[First Normal Form]] (1NF) ( without multi-valued attributes )
2. [[Second Normal Form]] (2NF) ( without Partial Dependencies )
3. [[Third Normal Form]] (3NF) ( without Transitive Dependencies )
4. [[Boyce-Codd Normal Form]] (BCNF or 3.5NF) ( without Non-trivial functional dependencies )
5. [[Fourth Normal Form]] (4NF) ( without Multivalued Dependencies )
6. [[Fifth Normal Form]] (5NF) (PJNF or Project Join Normal Form) ( without Join Dependencies )
7. NF6 ( still in research, standards do not ready yetâ€¦ )

>[!NOTE]
>Normalization is important because it helps to minimize redundancy and data inconsistencies, which can lead to problems such as data corruption and difficult-to-maintain databases. It also makes it easier to update and query the database, because there are fewer dependencies between the different data elements.
