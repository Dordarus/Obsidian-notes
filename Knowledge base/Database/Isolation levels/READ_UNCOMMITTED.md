This is the lowest level of isolation, and does almost nothing. It means that transactions can read data being worked with by other transactions, even if the changes aren’t committed yet. ___READ_UNCOMMITTED___ doesn’t avoid ==any== of the [[Transactions#Reading phenomenas|read problems]] three read problems that we outlined before.

In fact, if we look at the documentation of Postgres, we can see that ___READ_UNCOMMITTED___ in Postgres behaves exactly the same as _[[READ_COMMITTED]]_. Basically, we can say that Postgres only have 3 isolation levels, and the lowest level is _[[READ_COMMITTED]]_. It makes sense because normally we would never want to use ___READ_UNCOMMITTED___ in any circumstances.
