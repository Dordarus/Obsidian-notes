The most popular isolation level is _REPEATABLE_READ_, which (surprise!) helps avoid [[Non-Repeatable Reads|non-repeatable reads]]. This iso level locks data from the start of the entire [[Transactions|transaction]] – including on `SELECT` queries – as opposed to the start of the ___query___, which adds an additional layer of isolation.

If you recall from above, a non-repeatable read happens when one transaction has two `SELECT` queries, and another transaction is able to insert or update a row that makes those two `SELECT` queries show different results. _REPEATABLE_READ_ isolation avoids that by letting the first transaction acquire a lock when it starts the first `SELECT` query.

_REPEATABLE_READ_ isolation level ensures that ___all read queries___ are repeatable, which means, it always returns the same result, even if there are changes made by other committed transactions
