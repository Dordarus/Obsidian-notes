Blue-green deployment is a technique for rolling out new versions of software or infrastructure in a way that minimizes downtime and risk. The idea is to have two identical production environments, known as "blue" and "green," with the green environment serving live traffic and the blue environment standing by. When you want to deploy a new version of your software, you first deploy it to the blue environment, test it thoroughly to make sure it's working as intended, and then switch live traffic over to the blue environment, effectively "switching" the blue and green environments. This ensures that there is always a stable, known-good version of the software available, and it allows you to quickly roll back if something goes wrong.
