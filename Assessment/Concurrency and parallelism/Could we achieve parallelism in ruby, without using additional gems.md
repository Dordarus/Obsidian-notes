It is possible to achieve parallelism in Ruby without using additional gems, but it is generally more difficult and requires more manual work. One way to achieve parallelism without using a gem is to use the built-in "Thread" class, which allows you to create and manage threads of execution. You can then use this class to create multiple threads that execute different parts of your code simultaneously.

However, using the "Thread" class to achieve parallelism can be challenging, because it requires you to manually manage and synchronize the threads, and to handle potential race conditions and other issues ([[Potential issues]]) that can arise when executing code in parallel. Additionally, the "Thread" class does not provide any built-in tools for dividing work or distributing tasks across multiple threads, so you will need to implement this functionality yourself.

Overall, using a gem like the "parallel" gem is generally recommended for achieving parallelism in Ruby, because it provides a more convenient and robust solution. However, if you prefer not to use a gem, or if you need more fine-grained control over the parallel execution of your code, you can use the "Thread" class to achieve parallelism without using a gem.
