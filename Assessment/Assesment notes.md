# What was good and should be recognized  
## Expert 1 
* Optimized application performance Released and maintained new API versions using Grape API framework Created a separate engine for API 
* Has experience as team lead
* A good feedback from a colleagues English communication skills are good 
## Expert 2 
* Multiple complimentary feedbacks from the team, Daniel is considered to be valuable part of the team 
* Noticeable contribution into the project 
## Expert 3 
* Daniel has experience leading the team and being the key developer. 
* His contribution is recognized by colleagues and managers, what is reflected in feedbacks he got and badges he was awarded.
* I would like to highlight his presentation and communication skills that he demonstrated during the session. 
* He has strong basic IT knowledge. Based on questions he answered during the session, he has strong knowledge in relational databases and Ruby development (still having some gaps, but who doesn't?). 
## Expert 4
Daniel gave a great presentation, described his role and challenges he faced during his career at EPAM. He has a great feedbacks from the team and was confidently answering soft skills questions during the assessment. 
### Soft skills questions:  
* How to calculate a risks for the feature assigned? Ways to mitigate them?  
* Your guiding for successful team-management in terms of team-mates motivation. 
* How do you deliver a fact of missed deadlines to the customer? - Good answer  
* What does it mean to you be a senior engineer ? 
* What will change with new title ? 
* Please share your the most valuable achievement on a project for selected period from technical point of view.  
* Description of the biggest mistake and the biggest achievement. What experience did you get from them? 
### Hard skills:  
* Development processes and methodologies - Mostly good answers ( with the exception for [[DoD vs DoR]] question ).  
* How do you select [[Non-functional requirements]] for a new feature/project? Examples.  
* Sidekiq can process some tasks in parallel, How it's able to process the jobs in parallel?  
* DB transactions (ACID, Isoloation levels) - good answer 
* Over all Daniel was answering questions confidently and has shown a good knowledge in the most of the crucial areas.  
# What can be improved  
## Expert 1
### Good to understand principles  
* Understanding [[Non-functional requirements]]
* [[Blue-Green Deployment]] (Principles)  
* [[How to deploy dependent microservices]] (Principles)
### Good to know  
* [[Two-phase commit]]
* [[Types of software tests]]
## Expert 2
Nice to have: 
* [[Software development methodologies]]
Must have:
* [[Concurrency and parallelism]]
* [[The testing pyramid]]
## Expert 3
### Engineering Process: Agile and Scrum. 
While Daniel has pretty good experience of using Agile technologies, he has some gaps there. For example, he wasn't aware of ==Definition of Ready== ([[DoD vs DoR]]) term, was unable to describe possible ==non-functional requirements for feature and how to prerare/process them== ([[Non-functional requirements]]). 
### Architecture and Design principles: Microservices. 
Daniel has difficulties answering the questions about microservices principles and deployment (criterias for service extraction, zero-downtime deployment, dependencies). 
### Testing: 
Daniel is not aware of testing strategies, had difficulties with naming other test types except unit tests. While he has basic knowledge and understanding why tests are vital, his deep knowledge of testing process should be improved. 
## Expert 4
Daniel has shown a few ares that can be improved:  
### Concurrency vs Parallelism in ruby
[[Concurrency and parallelism]]
it felt like he had not enough experience working with these concepts in Ruby and the theoretical explanation was a little bit off. 
### Why I would migrate to microservice from huge monolith application? 
The answer was lacking details and some major points about scaleablility, deployments and development advantages.  
### How to deploy dependant microservices?
poor answer especially in the part of [[Blue-Green Deployment]] strategy  
### Optimistic vs pessimistic locks (when should I use them) 
[[Optimistic and pessimistic locks]]in databases not the best answer over all, missed a few crucial topics.
